#MDS : Master Data Services
[Context](https://github.com/Fleid/SQLSat-Paris-2014---DQS-MDS-PreConf/blob/master/README.md)

The **problem** that MDS tries to solve is MDM (Master Data Management): define core identities in the company (a customer, a product...) and have the same entities used everywhere in all applications

MDM lives in 2 places : between LoBs, (MDM operational), and between LoBs and DWH (MDM analytical)
