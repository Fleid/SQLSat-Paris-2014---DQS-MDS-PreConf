# Data Curation
[Context](https://github.com/Fleid/SQLSat-Paris-2014---DQS-MDS-PreConf/blob/master/README.md)

##Role Definition
Features in the products are more or less mapped on these roles:
- Information Worker (the creator and consumer of data)
- Data Steward (he is in charge of the quality, and good usage, of the data, where it is used)
- IT-Professional (build systems that enable everything)
Data curation is a feedback loop:
1. Knowledge worker does something with data
2. A data analyst help defining what needs to be done
3. The developer build what is required
4. The IT Pro integrates everything
